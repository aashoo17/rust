//what is NonNull and its usage

//how NonNull<T> is covariant over T is it because it uses only one field which has *const T and we know that *const T is
//covariant over T as this gives read only access to T

//so NonNull is created same as Unique<T> use a *mut T to create NonNull and cast it to *const T
//over this *const T NonNull will be wrapper

use core::ptr::NonNull;

pub fn create_nonnull() {
    let a = &mut 10 as *mut i32;
    //use only new which is safe
    let mut b = NonNull::new(a).unwrap();
    let c = unsafe { NonNull::new_unchecked(a) };

    //get pointers
    //TODO: why variable b which is NonNull is not getting consumed when we see all these 3 functions below take self as input
    let d = b.as_ptr();
    let e = unsafe { b.as_ref() };
    let f = unsafe { b.as_mut() };

    //cast
    let g = b.cast::<u32>();
}

//NonNull<[T]> = how NonNull over arrays conceptually works as it has pointer only but no length
//is it like c we have to provide length from outside and has to be careful that we are not going out of bounds

pub fn nonnull_array() {
    //so we should get a ptr to array in advance so that when creating NonNull<T>
    let a = &mut [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] as *mut [i32];
    let b = a.as_mut_ptr();
    let c = NonNull::new(b).unwrap();
    //create
    let d = NonNull::slice_from_raw_parts(c, 5);
    let e = d.len();
    let f = d.as_non_null_ptr();
    let g = d.as_mut_ptr();
    //slice
    let h = unsafe { d.get_unchecked_mut(1..4) };
    //TODO: traits
}
